Performance issues occur primarily during search operations. The goal is to improve performance and maximize resource efficiency. Analyze the Requirements: The solution should improve the performance of the platform. It should maximize resource efficiency, which implies cost-effective and scalable options. Evaluate the Options: Option A: Deploy an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster. ElastiCache for Redis is a managed in-memory caching service that can significantly reduce the load on the database by caching frequently accessed data. By modifying the application to check the cache before querying the database, repeated searches for the same information will be served from the cache, reducing the number of database reads. This is efficient and cost-effective as it reduces database load and improves response times. Option B: Deploy an Aurora Replica and use Auto Scaling. Adding Aurora Replicas can help distribute read traffic and improve performance. Aurora Auto Scaling can adjust the number of replicas based on the load. However, this option may not be as efficient in terms of resource usage compared to caching because it still involves querying the database. Option C: Use Provisioned IOPS. Provisioned IOPS can improve performance by providing fast and consistent I/O.",
