DNS resolution fails when the on-premises application tries to connect to the EC2 instance. The goal is to implement DNS resolution between on-premises and AWS resources. Analyze the Requirements: Need to resolve the hostname of the EC2 instance from the on-premises network. Utilize the existing AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection for DNS queries. Evaluate the Options: Option A: Set up an Amazon Route 53 inbound resolver endpoint with a forwarding rule for the onprem.private hosted zone. This allows DNS queries from on-premises to be forwarded to Route 53 for resolution. The resolver endpoint is associated with the VPC, enabling resolution of AWS resources. Option B: Set up an Amazon Route 53 inbound resolver endpoint without specifying the forwarding rule. This option does not address the specific need to resolve onprem.private DNS queries. Option C: Set up an Amazon Route 53 outbound resolver endpoint. Outbound resolver endpoints are used for forwarding DNS queries from AWS to on-premises, not vice versa. Option D: Set up an Amazon Route 53 outbound resolver endpoint without specifying the forwarding rule. Similar to Option C, this does not meet the requirement of resolving on-premises queries in AWS. Select the Best Solution: Option A: Setting up an inbound resolver endpoint with a forwarding rule for onprem.private and associating it with the VPC ensures that DNS queries from on-premises can resolve AWS resources effectively.
